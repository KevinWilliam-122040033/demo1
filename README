If you are new to Github, you can download Github desktop, should be a much easier way to get familiar with Github.




By using the correct Maven file, you only need to worry about installing MySQL.
You need to install MySQL server on your local device and start the service.
Remember to use the mysql lines to initialize the database

Basics:
    1. You need to have at least 1 working Main class/method to run your code
    2. For JFX projects, you need to implement(override) the start function for initialization
    3. Call launch(args) in your main method

Tips:
    1. Make sure to update your pom.xml if you want to add some other dependencies into the project
    2. To package such a JFX project, you can either:
        i. use javafx-maven-plugin to compile a cross-platform zip
        ii. directly package the project as a .jar file if using JDK<=8.0
        iii. discover other ways to package into .jar file using newer JFX
    3. !!!!MAKE SURE!!! your .jar/.zip file can run by itself; you may lose pts
        if we have to manually compile and run your program.
    4. Maven works well with intellij, make good use of it.
